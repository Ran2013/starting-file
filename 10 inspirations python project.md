Hi there fellow coders. I know those times when we don’t know what to code. I am sure you must have experienced that time as well. Today i am going to share with you 10 python projects that will serve as an inspiration for your next python project. So without wasting a time here’s the list.

1. Pillow . Pillow is the “friendly” PIL fork by Alex Clark and Contributors. PIL is the Python Imaging Library by Fredrik Lundh and Contributors. Alex teaches us that if you don’t like something then make a fork.

2. Inbox.py. This is the simplest SMTP server you’ll ever see. It’s asynchronous. One instance should handle over one thousand emails per second. Pretty impressive.

3. PyMinecraft. Have you ever thought of implementing the famous minecraft game into python ? Hawstein has.

4. fuqit. The latest and greatest from Zed Shaw (the writer of learn python the hard way) , fuqit is a web framework that attempts to make you forget everything you have learned from MVC frameworks and focuses on simplicity. Zed Shaw teaches us one thing through this project “Don’t panic while doing something against the trend”.

5. PyPI Notifier. Watches your requirements.txt files and notifies you via email when a project is updated. Although i have not used it myself but i think this project is great.

6. Vol. A simple project but great inspiration. vol lets you control your mac’s audio volume from the commandline. It also has support for profiles.

7. Youtube-dl. A great python project. It allows you to download videos from various websites. It’s a great project make sure that you check it out.

8. Jukebox. Ever wanted to listen to music with a larger group of people e.g. in your office? Who decides what to play? Make your music player democratic and give everyone the chance to promote their favourite song. This script will relieve you from numerous fights.

9. Mitmproxy. mitmproxy is a an SSL capable man-in-the-middle-proxy. It allows HTTP(and other) traffic to be inspected and edited on the fly. Don’t be caught unaware by apps like Path any more, now you can know what data you are sending and receiving from remote servers.

10. Thumbor. It is a smart imaging service. It enables on-demand crop, resizing and flipping of images. I haven’t checked it out though but it seems promising. Do check it out if you want a server side image cropper.

So finally we come to the end of this post. I hope you found some useful python projects in there to serve as an inspiration. Share your views in the comments below and tell me which project you liked the most or if you want to read further then check out my another blog post about 20 python libraries you can’t live without.
